This is my `~/.emacs.d`.

It uses the [emacs-starter-kit](https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit) packages along with others from
[marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org/).

Requires Emacs 24, currently available from [source](https://github.com/emacsmirror/emacs) or via
[Homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew) with:

```
brew install emacs --HEAD --use-git-head --cocoa
```
